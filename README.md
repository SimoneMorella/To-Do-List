# To-Cool-List

To-Do-List webApp that can divide tasks in "Projects".

---
## How it works?

At the beginning, just create a new project and name it. 
After that you can start inserting tasks that you have to complete!
Of course, you can create as many projects as you want so don't worry! *(maybe categories was a better name)*
After that you can watch in the first three categories:
+ All tasks in every projects
+ The tasks due today
+ All completed tasks

## Additional info on development

This website was created with the mobile-first design methodology.
This means that the website gives its best from a mobile in terms of responsiveness and design!
I'm a graduated design student so I try to give my best on the design part *(especially on mobile)*.
In addition, TailwindCSS was used for the styling while Vite for the deployment. The rest of 
the business logic was written in JavaScript.

Below a live version of the website!
